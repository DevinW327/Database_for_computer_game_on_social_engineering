Welcome to the Database_for_computer_game_on_social_engineering project

To run this code first you will need to make sure you have MySQL installed on your machine.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/connect-python-with-sql/ - This tutorial can help setup MySQL on your machine

Next download the Python notebook from this repository.

Open the Python notebook in an IDE that supports running .ipynb files like Jupyter Notebook.

Next you will need to modify block 3 of the code to match your credentials for MySQL.

From there you will be able to run the code block by block or all at once.

If all is successful, you should see the GUI popup for the home screen of the game.
